# What is this?

This is a collection of diagnostic utilities that will tell you things about the system you're running on and stuff like
that.

## Requirements

- make
- a C compiler (I've only tested, and will recommend, gcc, but I'm not doing any crazy compiler magic)
- a compliant C standard library (again, glibc is what i've tested with, but I'm sure there are others that work)

## How to build

`make` should build all targets known at the time if you run it without arguments.
